This tool allows to find __AS400__ usernames.

The existing __NSE__ script that works on __Mainframe__ does not work on __AS400__ (there is no __TSO__ on __AS400__). So I coded this one to be able to bruteforce __AS400__ username.

There is a limit of 3 tries per user (most of the time). Keep that in mind.

It works on linux and windows as well.

You can test a single __username:password__

Or a predifined list
